                Board Games are one of my favourite hobbies - I enjoy many kinds of genres: Puzzle, Strategy, Card Games, and even a Party Game every once in a while.
                The board games you see on store shelves has evolved from what can be considered the first contemporary board game, <i>The Landlord's Game (1904)</i>, the origin of the world-famous <i>Monopoly</i>. The market for board games has grown exponentially since then, with a massive increase of published games in the years after 2010.
